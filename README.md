# Helium-Leak-Detection-ML-Model
This project presents a helium leak detector for spaceships that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze visual patterns from Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) cameras. By combining advanced machine learning with practical applications in space technology, this work is to focus on my passion for both physics and computer science
